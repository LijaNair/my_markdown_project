## Introduction

This repository contains a **sample API documentation project** focused on:

- A **Weather API** using the **GET** method
- A **Task API** (hypothetical) using the **POST** method

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to create well-structured API documentation using **DITA** and **Oxygen XML Editor**. The output of this documentation is a professionally formatted **PDF file**, showcasing all essential elements required in a standard API documentation project.
